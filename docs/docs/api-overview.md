### **API Overview**

This package provides two types of APIs for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs):

1. **React Hooks**: Simplified APIs for managing models and generating responses declaratively.
2. **Hookless APIs**: Advanced APIs for developers who prefer manual control over model lifecycle and inference.
